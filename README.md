# Impact-of-Social-Media-on-Productivity-Levels
Project Description: This is a Power BI project where analysis of users’ productivity levels on social media usage is done to understand the extent of productivity loss and to identify social media usage patterns. It also includes users background and their behavior to examine how these factors influence social media platforms handling ultimately leading to productivity loss. The data is taken from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadroshaanriaz/time-wasters-on-social-media

Problem Statement:
In today’s digital life, social media plays a huge role in distraction of user’s time management and productivity. However, there is a need to identify social media usage patterns and the extent to which social media affects users’ productivity. Depending upon users’ profile and their behavior, the challenge lies in interpreting the data effectively to draw meaningful conclusions that can inform strategies to mitigate negative impact of social media on users’ daily routines and productivity levels. 

Objectives:
1.	To analyze users background and their behavior that can influence the social media handling. 
2.	To identify social media usage patterns. 
3.	To examine platform specific impact.
4.	To measure extent of time spent on social media.
5.	To provide meaningful insights to stakeholders to develop strategies that can help time management and minimize productivity loss due to social media.

Methodology:

Data Cleaning and Transformation: 
I used Power Query Editor to remove duplicates, define datatypes and created conditional columns such as Age group and Productivity loss category. 

Creation of DAX measures:
Created measures for % Self-control, % addiction levels, total productivity loss, category wise % current activity.

Interactive Dashboard:
Used Power BI Desktop to visualize the impact of social media based on users’ profile and their productivity levels. 

Key Insights:
1.	Average minutes spent on social media platforms. – 151.41 mins (i.e. 2.5+hrs)
2.	Average number of sessions by users. – 10
3.	Average time spent on a single video. – 14.97 mins
4.	Maximum scrolling rate in the evening.
5.	Students followed by working staff are the top professions who experience maximum productivity loss at moderate level.
6.	The most affected current activity by social media. – At home (38.10%)
7.	Highest (33.10%) addiction levels were seen in 60-above age group whereas highest self-control ability (72.24%) seen in younger generation.

Recommendations: 
1.	Social media platforms can improve the built-in tools that can track and limit time of users on the platform. In other cases, third-party apps can be used.
2.	Creation of to do list in the platforms or apps that can remind to prioritize users’ tasks.
3.	Educate the users particularly in the academic institutes about the social media impact on productivity loss.
4.	Encourage users to analyze the patterns of social media usage on daily basis.
